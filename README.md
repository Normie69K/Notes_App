# Notes_App
A Notes App in Kotlin lets users create, view, edit, and delete notes with a title, description, and timestamp. Notes are saved offline using Room Database and displayed in a RecyclerView. Built with Material Design and MVVM (ViewModel + LiveData), it covers core Android concepts like activities, CRUD, and local storage.
